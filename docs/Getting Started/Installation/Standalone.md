# 1️⃣ Standalone Unity

Before anything else, make sure your color space is set to linear:

## Installing LTCGI

For **standalone Unity**, you can import LTCGI as a [git package](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) with the URL: `https://github.com/PiMaker/ltcgi.git`

> ⚠️ If you are importing LTCGI into an existing project, make sure you have a backup first!
