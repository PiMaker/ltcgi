# 2️⃣ Attribution Requirements

According to the [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiMaker/ltcgi/main/LICENSE) you are free to use LTCGI in your world, but you need to give credit. You are free to do so in whichever way, but you must provide a link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pimaker/ltcgi), such as to fulfill the imported license of the LTC example code used as a base for this project.

For your convenience, a prefab called `LTCGI Attribution` is provided in the package.

**You do _not_ need to use this as-is, as long as a link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pimaker/ltcgi) is provided!**

If you don't want to use it, instead display text similar to the following:

```
This project/world uses LTCGI by _pi_, see 'github.com/pimaker/ltcgi'.
```
